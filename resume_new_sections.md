## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Zapier, Remote**                                                                January 2017 â€“ October 2025
*Senior Engineer, Backend (2023-2025) | Integrations Engineer (2019-2023) | Data Engineer (2017-2019)*

- **Founded data engineering function** as Zapier's first Data Engineer, building production ETL infrastructure using Apache Airflow and Matillion on AWS to ingest from diverse sources into Redshift data warehouse organized in star schema.

- **Created "Assertion Machine" data quality framework**, democratizing data quality checks via config files; automated SQL validation and Slack alerts allowed teams to detect data anomalies immediately.

- **Built supervised learning classifiers** to classify support tickets by difficulty; created real-time model performance monitoring with a Slack slash command.

- **Owned strategic integrations**, including Zoom, Slack, Facebook Lead Ads, and Gmail; overhauled underperforming Zoom integration during pandemic when demand surged; improved Slack's API by surfacing edge cases only visible at high volume.

- **Architected firehose webhook handling for CLI apps**, unlocking functionality previously limited to monolith integrations; eliminated custom API requirements for partners like Zoom, enabling dozens of apps to use standard webhook patterns.

- **Delivered enterprise platform features** using Python, Django, and DRF: shipped Alerts system from concept to production as part of Enterprise SKU with optimized performance (reduced p90 from 7s to 3.5s through caching and parallel GraphQL); migrated Notification Rules' heaviest email traffic to Knock for improved resilience, observability, and customization; led QA and architected synchronization layer for Multi-Product Folders (Org Service) to maintain consistency between local database and distributed permissions API.

- **Championed AI adoption**, recognized as organizational leader in Claude Code usage, producing training demos and evangelizing AI-assisted development practices that accelerated code reviews, skills test evaluations, and development workflows across engineering teams.

- **Contributed to open source and engineering quality**: submitted accepted pull requests to Django core; implemented disaster recovery plans across services; enhanced testing frameworks; established infrastructure best practices including SonarQube deployment with comprehensive documentation.

- **Developed technical leadership** through mentoring engineers on complex PRs, leading architectural discussions, and conducting technical interviews; recognized for knowledge sharing through documentation, presentations (DjangoCon, internal talks), and cross-team collaboration.

## Notes for Integration

1. Replace the old CAREER OBJECTIVE section with the new PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
2. Add the Zapier work experience as the first entry under WORK EXPERIENCE
3. Update the TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCE section with the expanded technology stack
4. Consider whether to keep all the older NLP positions or condense them since they're 10+ years old
5. You may want to remove or significantly shorten the NLP PROJECTS section since it's from 2009
