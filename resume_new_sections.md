## Notes for Integration

1. Replace the old CAREER OBJECTIVE section with the new PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
2. Add the Zapier work experience as the first entry under WORK EXPERIENCE
3. Update the TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCE section with the expanded technology stack
4. Consider whether to keep all the older NLP positions or condense them since they're 10+ years old
5. You may want to remove or significantly shorten the NLP PROJECTS section since it's from 2009
